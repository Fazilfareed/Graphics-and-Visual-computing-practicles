🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Graphics-and-Visual-computing-practicles.git
Open a C++ IDE (eg-: microsoft visual studio code).

Make sure the graphics.h library is installed and configured.

Compile and run the .cpp files inside each folder.

⚡ Note: Some old graphics libraries may require DOSBox or a 32-bit compiler.

🎯 Purpose
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with key computer graphics algorithms, which form the foundation for modern graphical applications.
